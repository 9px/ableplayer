<h1>Able Player</h1>

<p>Fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player</p>

<p><strong>Able Player</strong> is a fully accessible cross-browser media player. It uses
the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; or &lt;video&gt; element for browsers that support them,
and (optionally) the JW Player as a fallback for those that donâ€™t.</p>

<p>In October 2014, we will be announcing the release of Able Player 2.0, 
a major upgrade with dozens of exciting new features.  
This project page will be updated soon with full documentation. 
Please stay tuned!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, here are some examples of version 1.1:</p>
