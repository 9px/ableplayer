<h1>Able Player</h1>

<p>Fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player</p>

<p><strong>Able Player</strong> is a fully accessible cross-browser media player. It uses
the HTML5 &lt;audio\&gt; or &lt;video\&gt; element for browsers that support them,
and (optionally) the JW Player as a fallback for those that donâ€™t.</p>

<p>This project page will be updated soon with full documentation plus examples. 
Please stay tuned!</p>
